# I Built a Bot to Watch For Me, But Then My Friends Wanted In

_(Written, June 27, 2025)_

In the first part of the series, I told the story of how a personal frustration led to a working prototype: a TypeScript script that could scrape websites for new Pokemon TCG products and send a notification to my private Discord server. It was a success - it worked! But it was also deeply limited.

The script was a blunt instrument. It could only post in one hardcoded channel (which was provided as an environment variable in the `.env` file), and at first it did not ping a specific role or worse, the `@everyone` ping. This quickly went from useful to annoying. When friends started asking, _"Can you add this to my server?"_ or _"Can it ping on our X channel instead?"_, I realized I didn't have a "bot". I had a script that only worked for me.

This post is about the journey of transforming that bland script into a flexible, interactive and user-friendly service that could be shared with others.

## The Problem: A Bot without a Brain

The prototype had several major shortcomings that I needed to address:

1. **No user interaction**: There was no way for anyone to communicate with the bot. It was a one-way street of notifications.
2. **Hardcoded configuration**: The notification channel was written directly in the code. Changing it meant I had to edit the code and restart the script.
3. **Ping nuisance**: There was a dilemma where I had to decide to either use the `@everyone` ping or create a new role for the bot to ping instead. Most of the responses regarding the `@everyone` ping were unfavorable, meaning that this was not a sustainable or polite way to operate.

To fix this, I needed to give the bot a way to be communicated and configured directly withing Discord.

## Choosing a framework: Hello `discordx`

While you can handle commands with the base `discord.js` library, I wanted a more structured and scalable approach. As an Angular developer, I love clean, organized code, and that's when I discovered `discordx`.

`discordx` is a framework built on top of `discord.js` that uses TypeScript decorators (`@Slash`, `@On`, etc.) to define commands and event handlers. This allowed me to create a clean, modular structure where every command and event could live on its own file. It felt organized and familiar.

## Giving admins control: The first slash commands

The first priority was to let server administrators control where the notifications were sent. I created two essential admin-only commands:

- `/register`: When run, this command designates the channel where the command was sent as the server's official destination for all stock alerts.
- `/unregister`: This command removes the setting, stopping all notifications on that server.

This was the first major architectural change. I had to create a `ServerConfigManager` that would save these settings to a persistent JSON file, mapping a Server ID to a Channel ID. Now, the bot could manage dozens of servers, each with their own unique notification channel.

## Solving the ping problem: The reaction role system

With channel selection solved, the next big problem were the pings. I already knew that the `@everyone` ping was not going to be considered. So, how could I notify only the people who genuinely wanted the alerts?

The solution was to create an **opt-in role**. The idea was simple: the bot would create a role (e.g. _"@PTCG Notify"_), and only users with that role would get pinged. But how could I possibly make it easy for the users to get this role without needing an admin to assign it manually?

This led to my favorite feature of the bot: the automatic reaction-role setup.

I used the `@On("guildCreate")` event decorator to trigger a sequence of actions whenever the bot joins a new server:

1. **Find a suitable channel** to post in (like `#general`, `#welcome`, `#bot-commands`, etc.)
2. **Automatically create the `@PTCG Notify` role**
3. **Post a welcome embed message** explaining what the bot does
4. **Add a ðŸŽ‰ reaction** to its own message

Finally, I created event handlers for `messageReactionAdd` and `messageReactionRemove`. Whenever the users clicks the ðŸŽ‰ reaction on that specific welcome message, the bot automatically assigns them the `@PTCG Notify` role. If they remove their reaction, the role is removed. It's a completely self-service, user-friendly system.

## The result: A True "Bot"

With these changes, the project had transformed. It was no longer a personal script but a genuine, sharable Discord bot. It could join any server, allow users to opt-in to notifications, and give administrators control over its behavior. The notification now respected the community by pinging a specific role instead of `@everyone`.
